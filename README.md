# Hand-Sign-Language-Recognition
# Hand Sign Recognition Using Mediapipe and TensorFlow

# 1. Libraries Used
OpenCV (cv2): Used for video capture, image processing, and displaying results.
MediaPipe (mediapipe): Provides robust hand tracking and landmark detection.
NumPy (numpy): Used for numerical operations, especially with arrays.
Pandas (pandas): Used for data manipulation and storage (CSV).
TensorFlow/Keras (tensorflow, keras): Used to build, train, and evaluate the machine learning model.
Scikit-learn (sklearn): Provides utilities for data preprocessing, such as label encoding and data splitting.
# 2. Algorithms Used
Hand Landmark Detection: MediaPipe's hand solution is employed, which uses deep learning models for real-time hand tracking and landmark detection.
Neural Network: A sequential model built with Keras containing fully connected dense layers. It utilizes the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for hidden layers and a softmax activation function for the output layer, suited for multi-class classification tasks.
# 3. Approach Taken
Hand Landmark Detection: MediaPipe is utilized to detect hand landmarks in real-time from webcam input. Each hand's landmarks are extracted as a sequence of 3D coordinates (x, y, z).
Data Collection: The landmarks are stored in a list, along with labels representing different hand signs. These are then saved to a CSV file for model training.
Model Training: The collected data is split into training and testing datasets. A neural network is trained on the hand landmark data to classify different hand signs.
Real-Time Prediction: The trained model is then used in real-time to predict the hand signs based on the landmarks detected by MediaPipe.
# 4. How Does It Work?
Data Collection: The video capture from the webcam is processed frame by frame. For each frame, hand landmarks are detected and stored. Labels are manually assigned to each frame to represent different hand signs.
Model Training: The collected landmark data is fed into a neural network that learns to associate landmark positions with corresponding hand signs.
Real-Time Prediction: During real-time execution, the model predicts the hand sign based on the current hand landmarks and displays the predicted sign on the screen.

# 5. Where Can It Be Used?
Sign Language Interpretation: Can be used in applications to interpret basic sign language gestures in real-time.
Human-Computer Interaction: Can be integrated into systems for gesture-based control of devices or interfaces.
Gaming: Used as a control mechanism in gesture-based games.
Virtual Reality (VR): Implemented in VR environments where hand gestures are required for navigation or interaction.
# 6. Purpose of This Project
The primary purpose of this project is to create a real-time system capable of recognizing hand signs using computer vision and machine learning. This system serves as a proof of concept for how hand gestures can be effectively recognized and interpreted by a machine, which can be extended to more complex applications like sign language translation.

# 7. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of using MediaPipe in combination with a neural network to recognize hand signs in real-time. While the solution is effective and relatively easy to implement with standard hardware, its performance depends on the quality of the dataset and can be improved through more sophisticated model architectures or additional data augmentation techniques.
This approach offers a cost-effective and accessible alternative to more specialized hardware solutions for hand gesture recognition, making it a valuable tool in various applications ranging from sign language interpretation to gesture-based control systems. However, further improvements in dataset diversity, model complexity, and real-time performance are necessary to make it robust enough for widespread use.
